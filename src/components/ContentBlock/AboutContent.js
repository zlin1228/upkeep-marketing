    type:'text',
    content:"<p>UpKeep was brought to life in 2015 by CEO, Ryan Chan, from an idea he had while he was working as a process-development engineer at a membrane manufacturing plant. He noticed that one of the biggest problems at the facility was the extremely cumbersome process of creating, keeping track of, and closing out maintenance work orders.</p><p>Whether it was a broken piece of equipment on the manufacturing line, a busted door lock, or a simple filter replacement, work orders would create stacks and stacks of papers that were easily lost and hard to prioritize. The team wasted a ton of time going back and forth from the production facility to the office multiple times a day so they could retype their notes into a desktop application.</p><p>Ryan realized that with modern cloud and smartphone technology he could create an easier solution and save the maintenance team hours a day and a lot of lost uptime. With mobility in mind, he set out on a mission to drastically improve the workflow, and therefore productivity, of maintenance teams across the globe.</p><p>After thousands of hours, gallons of coffee, and lots of feedback, UpKeep had lift off. Now, UpKeep is one of the most innovative CMMS products on the market and the first to approach maintenance management software from a mobile-first perspective. With UpKeep, workers can easily create work orders by simply snapping a picture, filling out a few fields, and sending it off to the maintenance department for repair — all from a mobile device. Over 40,000 users have already experienced the power of saving time and frustration with UpKeep and more are joining every day.</p>",
